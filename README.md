# DataScienceFieldAnalysis
Using Python and Streamlit, I created a web dashboard analyzing the data science job field in the US before the global pandemic of 2020. 

In addition I have also included the Jupyter Notebook file along with the Python file. 

If you have Streamlit, you can download my file and view my data web page. Below are some images that provide a preview to my app. 

First, we have the front page.

There are various charts and more data visulizations. I also filtered the data to focus on a sample location such as New York.

And I finally conclude with some contact info.
